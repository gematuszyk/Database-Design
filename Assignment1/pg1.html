    <h2>Functional Specification</h2>
    <p>	  &emsp;The application is meant to track what a user gets when they bought food from an establishment, how much they purchased it for, who they were with, and their overall rating of the purchase.  First the application has the user enter the food they bought, where they bought it and how much they paid for it.  Then it asks a series of questions about the food such as the presentation, preparation time,  if it was fresh, etc.  Afterwards, it asks a series of questions about what the establishment such as where the user bought the food, what was the waiting time, how far away was it, and lastly, if they were alone when they made their purchase.  If the user answers ‘alone’ then they are asked to rate what they thought of the purchasing experience otherwise they are directed to a few questions about who they went with to the establishment.  At the end a table is displayed with the food, who they went with, where they went and their rating.  The purpose of this is to show how different factors affect the user’s experience and rating of purchases.  Overtime, hopefully consumers will be able to track where they’ve had the best experience at eating establishments and where they haven’t.  That way they can see who they’ve had the highest satisfaction with and who they shouldn’t eat with anymore.  In conclusion, the application is best utilized over time to see how you should make changes to your eating habits.  <br>  </p>

    <h2>Technical Specification</h2>
    <p>	  &emsp; The application consists of 5 tables, one that logs the food and the amount spent, the second table logs details about the food, the third logs details about the eating establishment, the fourth logs information about who they went with and the fifth table logs the food, the establishment, who they went with and their overall rating.  There will be PHP that Inserts the food, amount spent and the location into the first table with a submit button.  Then below that there are a series of questions that also Inserts details about the food into the second table and then a few more questions about the eating establishment that also inserts into the third table. After each series of questions there will be a submit button to put the information into the table. The last question about where they ate will include a button asking if they ate alone or with someone.  This question will activate a show/hide feature depending on whether they chose ‘with other people’ or alone.  If they ate with other people then a few more questions will appear about whom they ate with, otherwise they are asked one final question, to rate their overall experience and then a table will appear with all their previous logs and their just-completed log of what they ate, who they ate with, where they ate and their satisfaction.  Next to the table header there will be a button named ‘Details’ if the user wants information about a certain experience they can click this and will be directed to a new web page with an organized table and all the details that the user inputted in the previous questions.  The applications is just to log information about their eating experiences so they can see correlations between people, food and places, it is not meant to produce calculations based on the information inputted.<br> <p>
