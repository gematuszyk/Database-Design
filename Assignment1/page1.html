    <h2>How Big Data And Analytics Are Changing Hotels And The Hospitality Industry</h2>
    <p>	  &emsp;Using Big Data analytics to understand the customer’s wants and needs better is the key to setting the successful hotels apart from their competitors.  The hotel industry uses yield management to gather data about their hotel’s local weather forecast, upcoming events and other factors to influence the number and type of guests checking in.  This is the direction hotels need to move in if they are going to compete. <br>
 	  &emsp;The hotel chain, The Red Roof Inn, saw a 10% increase in business in areas where they used yield management strategies.  Their marketing and analytics team gathered information from public datasets about weather conditions and flight cancellations.  Since most of their hotels are established around airports and most of their customers would use the web on their phones to search for nearby accommodations, they were able to target their marketing campaigns at mobile users. <br>
	  &emsp;Marriott and Starwood Hotels are other big hotel chains that uses Big Data Analytics but also in other areas outside of marketing.  Marriott uses structure and unstructured datasets to adjust their rates based on weather reports and local event schedules throughout the year. Starwood is also based around optimizing room pricing by looking at the local and worldwide event and weather reports for each of their customer.  Knowing the local  weather for their customer’s allows them to adjust their prices in the places they believe they would want to travel to at that time of the year.  This strategy has increases the hotel’s revenue by almost 5%.<br>
	  &emsp;In conclusion, the hotel industry is making big strides with accommodations by keeping track of their customer’s wants and needs during their stay.  Mobile devices play a big role with this by marketing to their customers when it is most imperative to use the hotel industry’s services.  Using Big Data analytics to follow this turns the customer’s data trail into tangible returns. The technologies used to capture the data in the hospitality industry could be from public databases that hold weather and event reports.

    <h2>Data Privacy: Key Elements Of An Information Governance Plan</h2>
    <p>&emsp;Today, companies believe that the more customer data you have, the better you will be when trying to connect with their wants and needs.  Unfortunately, this isn’t always true.  The article explains how too much data can actually hinder a companies privacy and reputation.<br>
	&emsp;Data stealing and hacking is a big problem recently because companies do not have the necessary defense systems to protect these huge amounts of stored data from skilled hackers.  The article explains how it is imperative to decrease the amount of data that companies are keeping.  Approximately 70 percent of data that companies keep is data they most likely will never need or use.  By eliminating this it would result in a dramatically simpler infrastructure and reduced risk of privacy breaches.<br>
	&emsp;Data hacks such as Target’s breach in December 2014 and January 2015 where over 40 million customer debit and credit card numbers were stolen and the Edward Snowden leak demonstrate that even information protected by big companies and the government are vulnerable.  The customers are also not the only ones feeling the effect, data breaches cost a company on average of $174 per record plus regulatory and legal penalties along with the significant damage to a company’s reputation.<br>
	&emsp;The priorities should lie with maintaining the privacy of customers and not gathering every bit of information about them.  Having the technology and the facilities to hold Big Data hopefully can be improved upon in the future. But until then companies need to develop process and policies that provide a comprehensive approach to safeguarding a company’s most valuable information.  These include security software but also restricting the staff’s access to the private data to decrease negligence or bad practice which is about 20% of the cause of data loss.<br>
	&emsp;In conclusion,  there are measures that need to be taken to prevent information and customer loss.  Big Data initiatives are shaping new personalized services, business models and optimized efficiency but without a strong handle on the company and customer’s data more problems are caused than are solved.  The technologies used to capture the Big Data mentioned in this article could be from customer's interactions with online forms or purchasing events.<br>  </p>
